Minimizing Coins: unbounded knapsack
Coin Combinations II: dp[i][j] = no. of ordered & distinct ways to make a sum of i, using the first j coins only.
                                Similar dp state also used in the Partition Problem:
                                No. of ways a number can be partitioned into.
                                Recurrence is: p(n,k) = p(nâˆ’k,k) + p(n-1,k-1)
