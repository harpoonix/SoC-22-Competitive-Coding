General configuration:

git config --global user.name <your git username in double quotes>
git config --global user.email <the corresponding email (no quotes)>

Cloning:
(in some directory)

git init
git clone <link>

---

Commands to push onto your remote repository:
(in a directory)

git init
git remote add <some name> <link>			// this adds a remote repo that we can use by <some name>
	e.g. git remote add origin <link>
You can use "git status" to see the status of your files
git add <file paths>					// adds changes in the working directory to the staging area
	Note: to add the entire directory, just use "git add ."
Can again use "git status" to see the status of files (added or not)
git commit -m "some message for this commit"
git push <the name you used for this remote repo> <branch name>

Since by default the branch on GitHub would be named "main" (once you create a repository there), you should do:
git checkout -b main, and then push (e.g. git push origin main)
