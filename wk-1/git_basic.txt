General configuration:

git config --global user.name <your git username in double quotes>
git config --global user.email <the corresponding email (no quotes)>

---

Cloning:
(in some directory)

git init
git clone <link>

---

Commands to push onto your remote repository:
(in a directory)

git init
git remote add <some name> <link>			// this adds a remote repo that we can use by <some name>
	e.g. git remote add origin <link>
You can use "git status" to see the status of your files
git add <file paths>					// adds changes in the working directory to the staging area
	Note: to add the entire directory, just use "git add ."
To add all changes across all parent directories, including file updations, new files, file deletions,
use git add -A
For only staging changes (deletions and updates) to existing files,
git add --update
It is however more meaningful to add groups of files that have some similarity, so that commit message can properly convey the commit details.
Can again use "git status" to see the status of files (added or not)
git commit -m "some message for this commit"
git push <the name you used for this remote repo> <branch name>

Since by default the branch on GitHub would be named "main" (once you create a repository there), you should do:
git checkout -b main, and then push (e.g. git push origin main)
